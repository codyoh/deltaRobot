from python, send an array of positions and speeds to arduino
    input: path eqn parametrized for t
            desired t or speed
    subdivide path into equal time intervals
        initially just divide it into 50 intervals
        calculate position for each interval and add it to array
        calculate speed from this position to next, add this to array
            Xcalculate distance


    output: [[x0, y0, z0, v0], [x1, y1, z1, v1], [x2, y2, z2, v2],...]


in arduino, loop through array of steps
    convert angle to step
    calculate speed of each motor bsed on speed of segment
    respectively set moveTo and speed of motors
    check if currentPosition == convertAnglesToSteps(targetPosition)
        if yes, next step
        if no, pass
    If stepQueue is empty, send a finished signal to python
